# PStream - Photo Stream

This is a quick agular 2 single page app which shows my photo stream from
Google Photos.

Functionality:

- login with google id
- show login status on home page ("public page").
- show last 15 photos from the Google Photos account of the logged in user
with image file name, date created, thumbnail image, camera model, altitude
 from the geolocation

## Technical

This is based on the template project
[A2B4O2OM](https://github.com/michaeloryl/angular2-bootstrap4-oauth2-webpack),
the original Readme is [here](./A2B4O2OM-README.md)

## TODO

some glitches with page reload, back button, etc. a lot of angular data seems
to get lost.

no tests at all. (maybe this could be useful to fix the above problems...)

## Disclaimer

this is just a prototype for testing some features. In no way is tis intended
to be production ready. Be warned and proceed at your own risk.
